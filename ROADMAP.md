# CATS N POINTS Road map

-----------------------

This document outlines the development plan both from a high level goals and from a low level plan. It will be updated as progress is made toward version 1.0.

## High level goals

* Evaluate Elm as a frontend language
* Evaluate Haskell as a backend language
* Evaluate Elm's potential potential for integration with Haskell (e.g. auto-generated backend-frontend communication)
* Understand where Elm stands when it comes to Progressive Web Apps
* A **SMALL** (less than 2k lines frontend, 500 lines backend) POC piece of software that can be used to track and measure anything

## Low level plan

### Phase 1

The end goal of this is to create the basic flow for the project:

* A page rendering the frontend
* Installation instructions
* Model -> View -> Update architecture

### Phase 2

The end goal is to establish how styles will be developed, making the project public and to  provide examples of a more advanced frontend architecture

* Live reload
* Hosted version of the site
* Model -> View -> Update -> Commands -> Subscriptions

### Phase 3

Progress on the actual piece of software

* Site sections
* Categories CRUD and UX
* Points CRUD and UX
* Basic styling

### Phase 4

Introduce extra functionalities
* Charts
* persistance

### Phase 5
